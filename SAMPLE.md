**Key Features Demonstrated:**
- **LT/GT operators**: Quantitative threshold comparisons
- **Threshold objects**: Structured value + unit + dataType
- **Compound logic**: Multiple IMPLIES within AND
- **Confidence/Strength**: Applied to quantitative relationships

## Improvements Implemented

Based on comprehensive architecture review, the following improvements have been made:

### 1. **ID System Clarification**
- **@id**: SHA-256 content hash (ONLY unique identifier)
- **logicalId**: UUID v4 for logical grouping across versions
- **commitHash**: Tracks which commit this version belongs to
- Examples now show proper `sha256:...` format instead of placeholder strings

### 2. **Complete Metadata Examples**
- Added full `metadata` sections with source, author, version info
- Included `dateOccurred` vs `dateRecorded` distinction
- Added URL references for source tracking

### 3. **Standardized Modifiers**
- **Certainty modifiers** now included in most examples (confidence, source, evidence, reliability)
- **Temporal modifiers** use standardized enums (when, tense, phase, sequence)
- **Spatial, manner, degree** modifiers with consistent structure

### 4. **Unified Relationship System**
- Replaced scattered `causedBy/causes/relatedEvents` with unified `relationships[]`
- Each relationship has `type`, `target`, `strength`, `confidence`
- Clear semantic categories: causal, informational, contextual

### 5. **Complex Logical Examples**
- **NOT operator**: Denial and contradiction scenarios
- **BEFORE/AFTER**: Temporal logic with dependencies
- **Nested logic**: Multi-level IMPLIES with AND/OR combinations
- **Comparison operators**: GT, EQ for quantitative relationships

### 6. **Type Safety Improvements**
- **DataType system**: Supports custom schemas, arrays, unions, references
- **Modifier interfaces**: Prevent spelling errors with standardized enums
- **API versioning**: All endpoints use `/v1/` prefix for future compatibility

### 7. **Hash System Consistency**
- All references use content-addressed `sha256:...` format
- Clear distinction between content hash (@id) and logical grouping (logicalId)
- Version chains linked through `previousVersion` references

This enhanced translation framework enables VeritasChain to capture the full complexity of real-world events while maintaining logical structure for analysis, version control, and blockchain compatibility. The standardized approach ensures consistency across different contributors and prevents common implementation errors.
